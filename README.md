# AI Algorithm Playground

Welcome to the AI Algorithm Playground! This repository is a collection of basic AI algorithms focusing on various search techniques.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find simple yet effective implementations of essential search algorithms commonly used in Artificial Intelligence. Whether you're a beginner exploring the field or an experienced practitioner refreshing your knowledge, this repository aims to provide clear explanations and runnable code examples.

## Algorithms Included

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traverses a graph breadthwise.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Uniform Cost Search**: Expands the least-cost node first.
- **Hill Climbing Search**: Iteratively improves a solution.
- **Simulated Annealing**: A probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum.
- **Local Beam Search**: Maintains a set of k states rather than a single state.
